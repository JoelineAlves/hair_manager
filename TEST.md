## Code Validation

### W3C Markup Validator

All .html files were checked with the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) using the 'direct input' method.
These checks showed three pages with a missing closing div tag where I had copied and pasted the same snippet of code. This was fixed by moving the closing div tag from after the endif to the end of each card div.

The validator also highlighted missing head elements, illegal characters, missing lang attributes and no-space characters however these are due to use Jinga templating (see example below).

### CSS Validator

All CSS code was checked with the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) using the 'direct input' method. No errors found.

### JSHint Validator

This showed two warnings linked to the Materialize script on script.js

![jshint error image](/documentation/jshint_error.jpg)

It also showed two errors with two variables being used to call functions in sendEmail.js

### PEP8 Validation

PEP8Ci was used to validate the python code used in the app.py file. Some errors were detected, such as whitespaces, over-indented and blank lines.
These errors have all been duly corrected.

## Lighthouse

Responsivity tests were carried out using Google Chrome DevTools throughout the project.
The site has been run through the Lighthouse test on Google Developer Tools and achieved the following results:

Desktop - Home Page <br>
![desktop home]()

Mobile - Home Page <br>
![mobile home]()

The first test showed that there wasn't sufficient contrast between the text colour and the background colour so this was changed to the darker colour of #263238.

It also identified that the footer text was also not high enough contrast so the styling on that was increased to a h6 so that it was more legible.

Performance on some pages was lower than hoped which seemed to be affected by the external URLs for the site reviews.

## Bugs & Fixes

| Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- |
| Werzberg error showed Log out link not working  | On inspection the redirect in app.py was set to login rather than landing_page. Changed the redirect address. |
| Contact form wasn’t sending email |  Wrong setting saved for service, changed to correct service id. |
| Linting error for app.py - PEP8 warning: Missing two blank lines | Added additional blank lines. |
| Within manage locations html, when you click on delete modal, it does not delete the selected location. | By using Dev Tools inspect and running the site in debug mode, I realised that all the modals had the same ID. This meant that when delete was pressed, regardless of which location was selected, the first location in the database was being deleted as the wrong modal was being displayed, which meant the delete link in that modal had the wrong location ID. On closer inspection the same was happening with the site modal. To resolve this, I appended the location id/site id onto the modal element id. |
| Edit review page displaying missing image icon in top left corner. | URL field was missing forward slash, added that. |
| Review page not displaying static image | Added an if statement to display static image if missing image url |
| Delete app route not working | Added the missing @ in app route |
| Not redirecting to Login page when I tried to log in as an unregistered user | Change app route to return redirect(url_for("login")) |
